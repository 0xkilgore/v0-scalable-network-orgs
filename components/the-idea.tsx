            Scalable Network Organizations (SNOs) are a new model for organizing work in open networks. They combine the openness of the internet with the reliability of real-world institutions, giving communities the ability to coordinate, fund, and scale without relying on Big Tech or traditional corporations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed max-w-[85ch]">
            SNOs eliminate the trade-off between decentralization and scale. They make it possible to grow global networks that stay open, composable, and sovereign across every layer: infrastructure, legal, and social.
